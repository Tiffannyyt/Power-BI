ðŸ“¦ Power BI Project: Enhancing Supply Chain Monitoring
This Power BI project was developed as part of my Master's thesis at HTW Berlin (Hochschule fÃ¼r Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin). The goal was to improve order management agility and reduce late deliveries to below 5%, or ideally eliminate them entirely.

To support these objectives, the project involved the development of:

ðŸ“Š Reports:
- Current Month Orders: Overview of order volumes, fulfillment rates, top-selling products, and order status tracking for the current month. 
- Shipping Details: Tracks shipping process steps against their planned vs actual timestamps to identify operational delays.
- Order History: Historical analysis of all orders with performance distribution across time and products.
- Delivery Report: Analyzes delivery performance including on-time rates and common delivery bottlenecks.
- Inventory: Real-time inventory status with product demand and stock monitoring.

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard:
- Performance Monitoring Dashboard: Centralized executive dashboard displaying high-level KPIs to monitor fulfillment performance against targets. 

ðŸ›  Tools Used:
- Power BI Desktop
- Excel (data preparation & mock data generation)
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions for KPIs and calculations)

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome:
The dashboard provides visibility into delivery operations, helping stakeholders identify bottlenecks and ensure that on-time delivery performance stays within the defined thresholds.
